# Data Generation Plan to Improve Model Accuracy

## üéØ **Current Model Performance Issues:**

### **Problems Identified:**
1. **Class Imbalance**: Acne (122 images) vs Redness (66 images)
2. **Acne Bias**: Model over-detects acne, under-detects other conditions
3. **Low Recall**: Some conditions not being detected even when present
4. **Confusion**: Hyperpigmentation/Redness confused with Acne

### **Current Dataset Distribution:**
| Condition | Images | Needed | Gap |
|-----------|--------|--------|-----|
| Acne | 122 | 200 | +78 |
| Fine Lines/Wrinkles | 126 | 200 | +74 |

- Patches or spots darker than surrounding skin
- Common on cheeks, forehead, upper lip
- Uneven melanin distribution

---

### **Priority 2: MEDIUM - Improve Existing Conditions**

#### **5. AGING (Need +74 images)**

**Focus on MORE DISTINCTIVE aging features:**

```
Early Signs (25 images):
"Face showing early aging signs: fine lines around eyes (crow's feet),
slight nasolabial folds, minimal forehead lines, skin still relatively
firm, minimal sagging"

Moderate Aging (25 images):
"Face showing moderate aging: visible crow's feet, nasolabial folds,
forehead wrinkles, beginning of jowl formation, some skin laxity,
loss of facial volume"

Advanced Aging (24 images):
"Face showing advanced aging: deep wrinkles on forehead and around eyes,
pronounced nasolabial folds, jowls, significant skin laxity, neck lines,
volume loss in cheeks, thin skin texture"
```

**Key Visual Features:**
- **Wrinkles**: Forehead, crow's feet, nasolabial folds
- **Sagging**: Jowls, under-eye bags, loose skin
- **Volume loss**: Hollow cheeks, temples
- **Texture changes**: Thinner, crepey skin

---

#### **6. FINE LINES & WRINKLES (Need +74 images)**

**Make MORE DISTINCT from aging:**

```
Mild Fine Lines (25 images):
"Face with very fine lines visible around eyes when smiling,
minimal expression lines on forehead, skin still smooth and plump,
only visible up close"

Moderate Fine Lines (25 images):
"Face with visible fine lines around eyes, on forehead, and around mouth,
lines visible at rest, some depth to expression lines, skin showing
aging but not severe"

Severe Fine Lines (24 images):
"Face with deep, pronounced wrinkles around eyes (crow's feet),
across forehead (horizontal lines), around mouth (smoker's lines),
visible even without expressions, etched-in appearance"
```

**Key Differences from Aging:**
- Focus on **LINE PATTERNS** not overall aging
- Emphasize **wrinkle depth** and quantity
- Less focus on sagging/volume loss

---

#### **7. ACNE (Need +78 images) - Make MORE VARIED**

**Current problem: Model over-detects acne**

**Solution: Add more variety in NON-acne features:**

```
Mild Acne (26 images):
"Face with 3-5 small pimples or blackheads, scattered on forehead or chin,
mostly clear skin, minimal inflammation, NO other skin concerns"

Moderate Acne (26 images):
"Face with 10-15 pimples across forehead, cheeks, and chin,
mix of whiteheads and inflamed spots, some redness around breakouts,
NO hyperpigmentation, NO texture issues"

Severe Acne (26 images):
"Face with 20+ active breakouts including cystic acne, widespread across
forehead, cheeks, chin, significant inflammation, some pustules,
NO scarring (that's texture), NO dark spots (that's hyperpigmentation)"
```

**Key: Clearly distinguish from:**
- Hyperpigmentation (dark spots without active pimples)
- Redness (flush without raised bumps)
- Textured skin (scarring without active acne)

## üî¨ **Condition-Specific Visual Requirements:**

### **Critical: Each Condition Must be VISUALLY DISTINCT**

| Condition | Unique Visual Markers | What to AVOID |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------|
| **Acne** | Raised bumps, whiteheads, pustules, inflammation | Dark spots (that's hyperpig), just redness (that's redness) |
| **Redness** | Pink/red coloration, flush, broken capillaries | Raised bumps (that's acne), brown spots (that's hyperpig) |
| **Hyperpigmentation** | Brown/dark spots, patches, even skin surface | Raised bumps, active inflammation, textured surface |
| **Textured Skin** | Bumpy surface, scarring, roughness, shadows | Active acne, smooth dark spots |
| **Pore Size** | Visible pore openings, dots on surface | Overall texture, acne bumps |
| **Fine Lines** | Linear wrinkles, crow's feet, expression lines | Overall sagging, volume loss |
| **Aging** | Sagging, jowls, volume loss, overall maturity | Just wrinkles, just texture |

---

## üìä **Recommended Generation Strategy:**

### **Phase 1: Balance the Dataset (Priority: HIGH)**

Generate in this order:

1. **Redness**: 134 images (3 batches of ~45)

3. **Textured Skin**: 130 images (3 batches of ~43)
4. **Hyperpigmentation**: 122 images (3 batches of ~41)

**Cost**: ~$520 √ó 0.03 = **~$15.60**
**Time**: ~17 hours (with 30s delays)
**Result**: Balanced 1400-image dataset

### **Phase 2: Add Diversity (Priority: MEDIUM)**

For each condition, ensure diversity:
- **20% Very Fair skin** (Fitzpatrick I-II)
- **30% Fair/Medium skin** (Fitzpatrick III-IV)
- **30% Tan/Brown skin** (Fitzpatrick V)
- **20% Deep Brown skin** (Fitzpatrick VI)

**Ages:**
- 25% young (18-25)
- 40% adult (26-40)
- 25% middle-aged (41-55)
- 10% mature (55+)

**Genders:**
- 45% Female
- 45% Male
- 10% Diverse/Non-binary

### **Phase 3: Add Edge Cases (Priority: LOW)**

- **Multiple conditions** (acne + hyperpigmentation)
- **Subtle cases** (very mild conditions)
- **Severe cases** (extreme presentations)
- **Mixed skin tones** (vitiligo, uneven pigmentation)

## ü§ñ **Specific Gemini Prompts for Each Condition:**

### **REDNESS - 134 Images Needed**

#### **Mild Redness (45 images):**
```
Generate a photorealistic front-facing selfie portrait of a [age_group] [gender] 
with [skin_tone] skin tone. The person should have VERY SUBTLE FACIAL REDNESS, 
appearing as a gentle pink flush concentrated on the cheeks and nose, with maybe 
a few tiny visible broken capillaries. The redness should be mild and barely 
noticeable, giving a slightly flushed appearance. The rest of the face should 
have clear, even-toned skin with NO acne bumps, NO dark spots, NO texture issues. 
Face occupies 40-60% of frame, centered, plain light-gray background, even soft 
lighting, eyes to camera, full head and shoulders visible.
```

#### **Moderate Redness (45 images):**
```
Generate a photorealistic front-facing selfie portrait of a [age_group] [gender] 
with [skin_tone] skin tone. The person should have CLEAR FACIAL REDNESS appearing 
as noticeable pink-red coloration on the cheeks, nose, and chin, with visible 
broken capillaries (small red spider veins). The redness should be obvious but 
not extreme, similar to rosacea. Skin should otherwise be smooth with NO raised 
acne bumps, NO brown dark spots, NO rough texture. Face occupies 40-60% of frame, 
centered, plain background, even lighting.
```

#### **Severe Redness (44 images):**
```
Generate a photorealistic front-facing selfie portrait of a [age_group] [gender] 
with [skin_tone] skin tone. The person should have INTENSE WIDESPREAD FACIAL REDNESS 
covering most of the cheeks, nose, forehead, and chin with a deep red or purple hue. 
Include numerous visible broken capillaries and blood vessels. The skin should appear 
inflamed and flushed but with NO raised pimples or pustules (pure redness, not acne), 
NO brown spots (not hyperpigmentation), and smooth surface texture. This represents 
severe rosacea or extreme sensitivity.
```

---

### **PORE SIZE - 134 Images Needed**

#### **Mild Enlarged Pores (45 images):**
```
Generate a photorealistic front-facing selfie portrait of a [age_group] [gender] 
with [skin_tone] skin tone. The person should have SLIGHTLY ENLARGED PORES visible 
primarily on the nose and inner cheeks when viewed closely. The pores appear as 
tiny dots or pinpoint openings, creating a subtle texture. Skin is otherwise 
smooth and clear with NO acne bumps, NO redness, NO dark spots. Face occupies 
40-60% of frame, good detail to show pore visibility.
```

#### **Moderate Enlarged Pores (45 images):**
```
Generate a photorealistic front-facing selfie portrait of a [age_group] [gender] 
with [skin_tone] skin tone. The person should have CLEARLY VISIBLE ENLARGED PORES 
on the nose, cheeks, and forehead. The pores appear as distinct small dark dots 
giving a textured appearance to the skin, similar to orange-peel texture. Skin 
may appear slightly oily. NO active acne bumps, NO widespread redness, NO brown 
dark spots - ONLY enlarged pore openings.
```

#### **Severe Enlarged Pores (44 images):**
```
Generate a photorealistic front-facing selfie portrait of a [age_group] [gender] 
with [skin_tone] skin tone. The person should have VERY LARGE, PROMINENT PORES 
visible across the entire face creating a pronounced orange-peel texture. The 
pores are very obvious, appearing as large dark openings on the nose, cheeks, 
chin, and forehead. Skin appears very textured from pore visibility. NO raised 
acne, NO redness patches, NO dark spot discoloration.
```

---

### **TEXTURED SKIN - 130 Images Needed**

#### **Slight Texture (44 images):**
```
Generate a photorealistic front-facing selfie portrait of a [age_group] [gender] 
with [skin_tone] skin tone. The person should have SLIGHTLY ROUGH OR BUMPY SKIN 
TEXTURE with minor surface irregularities visible when light hits the face at 
an angle. Include a few very small raised bumps or minimal roughness on the 
cheeks or forehead. Skin tone is even (NO dark spots), NO active acne inflammation, 
NO redness - ONLY subtle texture/roughness.
```

#### **Moderate Texture (43 images):**
```
Generate a photorealistic front-facing selfie portrait of a [age_group] [gender] 
with [skin_tone] skin tone. The person should have NOTICEABLE BUMPY, ROUGH SKIN 
TEXTURE with visible surface irregularities creating shadows and uneven light 
reflection. Include some shallow acne scars (rolling scars), bumps, or rough 
patches on cheeks. The SURFACE is uneven but skin tone is relatively even 
(minimal dark spots), NO active red acne, just TEXTURE.
```

#### **Severe Texture (43 images):**
```
Generate a photorealistic front-facing selfie portrait of a [age_group] [gender] 
with [skin_tone] skin tone. The person should have SIGNIFICANTLY ROUGH, BUMPY SKIN 
with pronounced texture irregularities including visible ACNE SCARRING (ice-pick 
scars, rolling scars, boxcar scars), raised bumps, and rough patches creating 
heavy shadowing. The skin surface is clearly uneven and textured but skin tone 
is relatively even, NO active inflamed acne, NO widespread redness.
```

---

### **HYPERPIGMENTATION - 122 Images Needed**

#### **Mild Hyperpigmentation (41 images):**
```
Generate a photorealistic front-facing selfie portrait of a [age_group] [gender] 
with [skin_tone] skin tone. The person should have 5-10 SMALL DARK BROWN SPOTS 
or areas of darker pigmentation scattered on the cheeks or forehead. These are 
flat (not raised), appearing as slightly darker patches or freckle-like marks 
against otherwise even-toned skin. NO raised bumps (not acne), NO overall redness, 
NO rough texture - ONLY pigmentation differences.
```

#### **Moderate Hyperpigmentation (41 images):**
```
Generate a photorealistic front-facing selfie portrait of a [age_group] [gender] 
with [skin_tone] skin tone. The person should have MULTIPLE DARK BROWN SPOTS 
AND PATCHES across cheeks, forehead, and temples, creating noticeably uneven 
skin tone. Include larger patches of darker pigmentation (melasma-like) mixed 
with smaller spots. All pigmentation is FLAT (same texture as rest of skin), 
NO raised areas, NO red inflammation, just color variation.
```

#### **Severe Hyperpigmentation (40 images):**
```
Generate a photorealistic front-facing selfie portrait of a [age_group] [gender] 
with [skin_tone] skin tone. The person should have EXTENSIVE DARK BROWN TO BLACK 
PATCHES covering large areas of the cheeks, forehead, upper lip, and temples. 
The hyperpigmentation creates a very uneven, splotchy appearance with significant 
contrast between darker and lighter areas. All areas are FLAT and smooth (no texture 
difference), NO raised bumps, NO red coloration - ONLY pigmentation variation.
```

---

### **Priority 3: Refine Existing**

#### **ACNE (+78 images) - Make More Specific**

**Key: Distinguish from other conditions**

```
Focus on:
- RAISED BUMPS with visible inflammation
- Whiteheads, blackheads, pustules
- RED inflammation AROUND bumps (not general flush)
- Active breakouts (not scars)

Avoid mixing with:
- Hyperpigmentation (post-acne marks)
- Textured skin (acne scars)
- General redness (rosacea)
```
