  "prompt_used": "Photorealistic selfie, single male, mature (51-65 years old), \nwith deep brown skin tone (Fitzpatrick VI), front-facing, eyes to camera, full head and shoulders fully visible with small \nmargin around hairline and chin, subject centered, portrait orientation, face occupies ~40-60% of frame, \neven soft lighting, plain light-gray background, no hats, masks, sunglasses, hands, or hair covering \nthe face. \n\nCONDITION SPECIFIC: Face with EXTENSIVE DARK BROWN TO BLACK PATCHES covering large areas \nof the cheeks, forehead, upper lip, and temples. The hyperpigmentation creates a very uneven, \nsplotchy appearance with significant contrast between darker brown/black and lighter areas. \nLarge melasma-like patches dominate the face. All areas are FLAT and smooth (no texture difference), \nNO raised bumps, NO red coloration - ONLY dark brown/black pigmentation creating patchwork appearance.\n\nIMPORTANT: The face should show ONLY the specified condition. Skin should be otherwise clear and \nhealthy-looking except for the described condition. Do not mix multiple skin issues.",
