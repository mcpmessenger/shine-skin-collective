const [selectedImage, setSelectedImage] = useState<string | null>(null)
const [isUploading, setIsUploading] = useState(false)
```

### **New Functions**
- `handleFileSelect()` - Process selected file
- `handleUploadImage()` - Upload and analyze image
- `clearSelectedImage()` - Reset upload state

### **File Input**
```typescript
<input
  ref={fileInputRef}
  type="file"
  accept="image/*"
  onChange={handleFileSelect}
  className="hidden"
/>
```
