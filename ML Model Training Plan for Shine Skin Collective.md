# ML Model Training Plan for Shine Skin Collective

## 1. Objective

To train a machine learning model capable of multi-label classification of skin conditions and prediction of severity levels using the synthetic dataset provided in the `shine-skin-collective` repository.

## 2. Dataset Overview

The synthetic dataset, generated using Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model, comprises 311+ high-quality synthetic face images across 7 different skin conditions with varying severity levels. Each image is accompanied by comprehensive JSON annotations, including:

- `image_filename`: Name of the image file.
- `skin_condition`: Primary skin condition (e.g., "acne", "aging").
- `severity`: Overall severity level (e.g., "mild", "moderate", "severe").
- `classification_targets`: Boolean flags for the presence of each of the 7 skin conditions.
- `severity_targets`: Specific severity levels for each detected condition.
- `demographics`: Information such as age group, age range, skin tone, and gender.
- `training_annotations`: Additional annotations like `condition_detected`, `severity_level`, `confidence_score`, `affected_percentage`, and `feature_count`.

The dataset is structured into `output_images` containing subdirectories for each skin condition and severity level, along with `dataset_summary_*.json` files.

## 3. Model Training Plan

### 3.1 Data Preprocessing

1.  **Load Images and Annotations**: Load images from `output_images` and parse their corresponding JSON metadata.
2.  **Data Splitting**: Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets (e.g., 70% training, 15% validation, 15% test). Ensure stratified sampling based on skin conditions and severity to maintain class distribution.
3.  **Image Augmentation**: Apply various augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness and prevent overfitting. This may include:
    *   Random rotations
    *   Horizontal flips
    *   Brightness and contrast adjustments
    *   Random cropping and resizing
4.  **Normalization**: Normalize pixel values (e.g., to [0, 1] or [-1, 1]) based on the requirements of the chosen model architecture.

### 3.2 Model Architecture Selection

Given the task of multi-label classification and severity prediction, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based architecture is suitable. Potential architectures include:

-   **ResNet (e.g., ResNet50, ResNet101)**: Known for strong performance in image classification tasks.
-   **EfficientNet**: Offers good balance between accuracy and efficiency.
-   **Vision Transformer (ViT)**: For exploring transformer-based approaches in computer vision.

The model will likely require a custom head with multiple output layers to handle:

-   **Multi-label Classification**: A sigmoid activation for each of the 7 skin conditions.
-   **Severity Prediction**: Separate softmax or regression layers for each condition's severity, or a single multi-output layer depending on the specific approach.

### 3.3 Training Strategy

1.  **Loss Function**: 
    *   For multi-label classification, Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss will be used for each condition.
    *   For severity prediction, Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE) for discrete severity levels or Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression-based severity.
2.  **Optimizer**: Adam or SGD with momentum.
3.  **Learning Rate Schedule**: Use a learning rate scheduler (e.g., Cosine Annealing, ReduceLROnPlateau) to fine-tune the learning process.
4.  **Metrics**: 
    *   **Classification**: F1-score (macro/micro), Precision, Recall, AUC-ROC for each skin condition.
    *   **Severity**: Accuracy, Weighted F1-score, or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) depending on the approach.
5.  **Early Stopping**: Monitor validation loss and stop training if performance does not improve for a certain number of epochs to prevent overfitting.
6.  **Transfer Learning**: Utilize pre-trained weights from ImageNet or other large datasets to leverage learned features and accelerate training.

### 3.4 Experimentation and Evaluation

1.  **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, optimizer settings, augmentation parameters) using techniques like grid search or random search.
2.  **Cross-validation**: Consider k-fold cross-validation for robust model evaluation, especially if the dataset size is moderate.
3.  **Model Interpretability**: Use techniques like Grad-CAM to visualize which parts of the image the model focuses on for predictions, ensuring logical decision-making.

## 4. Tools and Libraries

-   **Programming Language**: Python
-   **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
-   **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy
-   **Image Processing**: OpenCV, Pillow, Albumentations (for advanced augmentations)
-   **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow, TensorBoard (for logging metrics, visualizing training progress)

## 5. Next Steps

1.  Implement data loading and preprocessing pipelines.
2.  Set up the chosen model architecture with a custom head.
3.  Begin initial training runs and evaluate performance.
4.  Iteratively refine the model and training strategy based on evaluation results.
